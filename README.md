# ACF Advanced Image Field

An [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) field type providing in-editor options and real-time preview of aspect ratio and focal point selection.

Uses the built-in image, group, number, and select fields to create a more advanced image field while leveraging ACF's native editor UI and back-end processing functionality. It also utilises WordPress/ClassicPress's built-in attachment meta for alt text, caption, and title values to keep data consistent across the site, avoid duplicate/redundant data being stored in the database and potentially causing confusion for editors.

## Status

This is an alpha release that has been minimally tested for use as a standalone field and within a flexible content field, from which I have no reason to think it wouldn't also work with repeaters but have not tested this. More extensive and automated testing will be carried out as I continue work on this.

## Installation

Zip package still to come. In the meantime, you can fork/clone/download this repo and place the `acf-advanced-image-field` folder in your WordPress `wp-content/plugins` directory and activate it as normal.

## Usage

The field returns an associative array value for use in your templates, with the following fields:

| Key            | Type                    | Description                                                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `image_id`     | `int`                   | The attachment ID                                                             |
| `url`          | `string`                | The image URL                                                                 |
| `aspect_ratio` | `AspectRatio`           | The selected aspect ratio                                                     |
| `focal_point`  | `array{x: int, y: int}` | The selected focal point coordinates                                          |
| `offset`       | `array{x: int, y: int}` | The percentage offsets required to position the image to suit the focal point |
| `alt`          | `string`                | The alt text set on the attachment                                            |
| `caption`      | `string`                | The caption set on the attachment                                             |
| `title`        | `string`                | The title of the attachment                                                   |

The `AspectRatio` type is an enum that matches keywords to common aspect ratios to ensure only valid values are used.
```php
enum AspectRatio: string {
	case STANDARD = '4:3';
	case PORTRAIT = '3:4';
	case SQUARE = '1:1';
	case WIDE = '16:9';
	case TALL = '9:16';
	case CLASSIC = '3:2';
	case CLASSIC_PORTRAIT = '2:3';
}
```

This plugin does not provide the HTML or CSS required to make the images format correctly on the front-end. You will need to do this in your theme.

**Example front-end code to come.**

## Back-end customisation

Developers can add and modify the options available using the `acf_advanced_image_options_fields` filter. By default, it contains the aspect ratio, focal point, and image offset field definitions.

For example, you could add a field like so:

```php
add_filter('acf_advanced_image_options_fields', function($fields, $parent_key) {
	array_push($fields, array(
		'key' => $parent_key . '_custom_option',
		'label' => 'Custom Option',
		'name' => 'custom_option',
		'type' => 'text',
		'instructions' => 'A custom option added via the acf_advanced_image_options_fields filter.',
	));
	
	return $fields;
})
```

You also have access to the existing field definitions, so you can:
- modify things like their labels, instructions, options, and default values,
- remove fields you don't want.

> [!WARNING]
> It is strongly recommended not to change any of the built-in field keys, names, types, or return values as this may break things or have other unintended consequences.
> If you use the filter to remove a field or change a field key or name (despite the above warning), please be aware that this _will not_ remove existing data for the removed/renamed field from the database,
